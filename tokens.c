//casting type:
A "widening" cast is a cast from one type to another, where the "destination" 
type has a larger range or precision than the "source" (e.g. int to long, float to double).
A "narrowing" cast is the exact opposite (long to int). A narrowing cast introduces 
the possibility of overflow.
